# Predicting Online Purchase Intent from Session Behavior

## Overview
This repository analyzes online shopping sessions to predict whether a visit results in a **Purchase**.  
It uses an adapted version of the **Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention** dataset (originally from the UC Irvine ML Repository) and a Jupyter Notebook that walks through EDA and a baseline predictive model.

**Key files**
- `online_shopping_session_data.csv` — session-level dataset (features listed below)
- `notebook.ipynb` — end-to-end analysis and baseline modeling
- `data_source.md` — data provenance and adaptation notes
- `rupixen-Q59HmzK38eQ-unsplash.jpg` — cover image

## Objective
- Understand which on-site behaviors correlate with conversions
- Train a simple baseline model (e.g., logistic regression or tree-based) to predict `Purchase`
- Provide an interpretable workflow suitable for iteration (feature engineering, model comparison, calibration)
